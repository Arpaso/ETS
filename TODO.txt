These are the tasks needed for ETS, not all for the consultant:

Cleanup Tasks:
Make barcode smaller by translating columns in json to numbers or something 
(current barcode around 1600+ chars can get down to 800 or less)
Audit Log views
Refract code to clean models and views and move utility functions into tools and simplify views 
Organize templates

Handel Silos:
Handel bulk load by weight
Possible solution is to if item is in bulk copy Weight into Items.... Handle reconversion when sending to compas.
Issue: Inconsistency in the bulk items, sometime the number of items is 0 sometimes it is a number....

Local Barcode generator:
Barcode Imager Aztec/QR-Code (local to server)(currently using google graphs api)

Installer:
Easy to install with no online access during install, download singel MSI/ZIP. (installing python and all packages needed and configuration with simpel interface)
Configuration by wizard

Offline Receipt:
Easy to install with no online access (see above).
Rely on Barcode to retrieve goods. 
Prints the receipt, and save it so it can be sent or uploaded to Dispatch server

Offline Dispatch (Needs internet access for syncing):
Easy to install with no online access (see above).
Synchronizes LTIs from Mother server,
Creates dispatch offline with barcode (as server, but not using google graphs)
Prints receipt, and at a later point upload to Mother server
To resolve: how to make waybill number sequence without conflict on offline.

Central Data-warehouse for reporting:
Reporting server that either connects and get all info form all Mother Node servers, or all servers push info to it

Connecting to multiple Compas Stations:
Single Mother node connected to multiple compas servers (case Pak/Afg)
To resolve: how to keep track of what Compas station to send dispatch/receipt to

Receipt from other Instance:
Manage receipt dispatched from other Mother Nodes
To resolve: how to keep track of what compas station to send dispatch/receipt to


All code should be "Single Source" i.e. the offline instances are using configuration to know what they are(exception: Data-Warehouse)






The ETS application is a interface to COMPAS to create, print and update waybills 
The system connects periodically to COMPAS to retrieve LTIs (Landside Transport Instructions), and then allows a warehouse keeper to create a Waybill against these, this dispatched waybill is then pushed into COMPAS, the waybill has a barcode containing all the info of the waybill that can be used to do the reception of the waybill even if the receiving station has no connectivity.

Needed development Work:

Extend the application so that it can used in an offline client mode both for the dispatch and receipt

Possible workflow
Actors:
ETS-M: ETS system connected to COMPAS-D and COMPAS-R, and internet
ETS-M2: ETS system connected to COMPAS-R2, and internet

ETS-D: ETS system executing the dispatch, intermittently connected to ETS-M 
ETS-R: ETS system executing the reception, "No" internet connectivity, i.e. should have method to extract records into transportable format such as a text file that can be e-mailed to xxx or uploaded onto ETS-M

WH-D1: Warehouse keeper for offline Dispatching Warehouse
WH-D2: Warehouse keeper for online Dispatching Warehouse
WH-R1: Warehouse keeper for Receiving Warehouse
WH-R1: Warehouse keeper for Receiving Warehouse2

CP-O1: COMPAS Officer COMPAS-D
CP-O2: COMPAS Officer COMPAS-R2

COMPAS-D: Dispatching Offices COMPAS STATION
COMPAS-R: Receiving Offices COMPAS STATION 
COMPAS-R2: Receiving Offices COMPAS STATION

Senario 1:
Same COMPAS station for both dispatch & Receipt
LTI Created in COMPAS-D
ETS-M extract LTI from COMPAS-D
WH-D1 synchronizes ETS-D with ETS-M
WH-D1 goes offline and creates Waybill(s) in  ETS-D
(WH-D2 creates waybill in ETS-M )*
WH-D1 Returns online and synchronizes  ETS-D with  ETS-M
CP-O validates dispatch and submits it to COMPAS-D
WH-R Receives paper waybill and scans it into  ETS-R
WH-R Updates & Prints Receipt using  ETS-R
WH-R Extracts and emails the receipt record to CP-O1
CP-O1 Uploads the  receipt record onto  ETS-M
CP-O1 validates receipt and submits it to COMPAS-D


Senario 2:
Different COMPAS station for dispatch & Receipt, single ETS system.
LTI Created in COMPAS-D
ETS-M extract LTI from COMPAS-D
WH-D1 synchronizes ETS-D with ETS-M
WH-D1 goes offline and creates Waybill(s) in  ETS-D
(WH-D2 creates waybill in ETS-M )*
WH-D1 Returns online and synchronizes  ETS-D with  ETS-M
CP-O validates dispatch and submits it to COMPAS-D
WH-R Receives paper waybill and scans it into  ETS-R
WH-R Updates & Prints Receipt using  ETS-R
WH-R Extracts and emails the receipt record to CP-O1
CP-O1 Uploads the  receipt record onto  ETS-M
CP-O1 validates receipt and submits it to COMPAS-R

Senario 3:
Different COMPAS station for dispatch & Receipt, two ETS system.
LTI Created in COMPAS-D
ETS-M extract LTI from COMPAS-D
WH-D1 synchronizes ETS-D with ETS-M
WH-D1 goes offline and creates Waybill(s) in  ETS-D
(WH-D2 creates waybill in ETS-M )*
WH-D1 Returns online and synchronizes  ETS-D with  ETS-M
CP-O validates dispatch and submits it to COMPAS-D
WH-R Receives paper waybill and scans it into  ETS-R
WH-R Updates & Prints Receipt using  ETS-R
WH-R Extracts and emails the receipt record to CP-O1
CP-O1 Uploads the  receipt record onto  ETS-M
CP-O1 validates receipt and submits it to COMPAS-R
