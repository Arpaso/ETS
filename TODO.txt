The ETS application is a interface to COMPAS to create, print and update waybills 
The system connects periodically to COMPAS to retrieve LTIs (Landside Transport Instructions), and then allows a warehouse keeper to create a Waybill against these, this dispatched waybill is then pushed into COMPAS, the waybill has a barcode containing all the info of the waybill that can be used to do the reception of the waybill even if the receiving station has no connectivity.
